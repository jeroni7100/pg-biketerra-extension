2. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**:
   - Open Google Chrome.
   - Navigate to [`chrome://extensions/`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22chrome%3A%2F%2Fextensions%2F%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22z%3A%5C%5Csrc%5C%5Cbiketerra-extension%5C%5Ccopilot-1.md%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fz%253A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FZ%3A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A171%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

3. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   - In the top right corner, toggle the switch to enable "Developer mode".

4. **Load Unpacked Extension**:
   - Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
   - Select the directory where your extension files are located ([`BikeTerraContentReader`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22BikeTerraContentReader%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22z%3A%5C%5Csrc%5C%5Cbiketerra-extension%5C%5Ccopilot-1.md%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fz%253A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FZ%3A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A194%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")).

5. **Verify the Extension**:
   - Ensure the extension appears in the list with no errors.
   - If there are errors, click on "Errors" to see the details and fix them accordingly.

6. **Test the Extension**:
   - Open a new tab and navigate to [`biketerra.com`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22biketerra.com%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22z%3A%5C%5Csrc%5C%5Cbiketerra-extension%5C%5Ccopilot-1.md%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fz%253A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FZ%3A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A208%2C%22character%22%3A67%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
   - Open the extension popup by clicking on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
   - Verify that the content is being read and displayed correctly.
   - Go to the extension options page by right-clicking the extension icon and selecting "Options".
   - Set the WebSocket address and save it.
   - Make changes to elements with class `hud` or `info` on [`biketerra.com`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22biketerra.com%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22z%3A%5C%5Csrc%5C%5Cbiketerra-extension%5C%5Ccopilot-1.md%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fz%253A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FZ%3A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A208%2C%22character%22%3A67%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") and verify that the changes are being broadcasted via WebSocket.

### Additional Tips

- **Debugging**:
  - Use the Chrome Developer Tools (F12) to inspect the background script, content script, and popup script.
  - Check the console for any errors or logs.

- **WebSocket Server**:
  - Ensure you have a WebSocket server running at the address you set in the options page to receive the broadcasted messages.

### Example Commands for WebSocket Server (Node.js)

If you need a simple WebSocket server for testing, you can use Node.js with the [`ws`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22ws%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22z%3A%5C%5Csrc%5C%5Cbiketerra-extension%5C%5Ccopilot-1.md%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fz%253A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FZ%3A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A175%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") library:

1. **Install [`ws`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22ws%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22z%3A%5C%5Csrc%5C%5Cbiketerra-extension%5C%5Ccopilot-1.md%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fz%253A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FZ%3A%2Fsrc%2Fbiketerra-extension%2Fcopilot-1.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A175%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")**:
   ```bash
   npm install ws
   ```

2. **Create a WebSocket Server**:
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   const WebSocket = require('ws');

   const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

   wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
     console.log('Client connected');
     ws.on('message', (message) => {
       console.log('Received:', message);
     });
   });

   console.log('WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080');
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

This setup will help you test the Chrome extension by verifying that the WebSocket messages are being sent and received correctly.
